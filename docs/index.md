This page will be used for the index of the help page. You can write _any_ **valid** Markdown code here.

Get started reading the [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more information on how to write using Markdown.

You can also use this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Always update the title on the front matter (the metadata on the top of the file) and the last update date. It should be in this format: YYYY-MM-DD.

Filenames should be URL-friendly: no spaces, words separated with `-` and only English ASCII characters. The filename will be used for the URL, except when there's an `index.md`. A file with that name will be interpreted as the default page for the parent folder.
